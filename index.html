                <p>As a professional web development agency, we care about our customers because they are the driving force behind our business. Without our customers, we would not be able to do the work that we love and be successful in our industry. That is why we take the time to understand our customers' needs and goals, and work closely with them to ensure that their projects are completed to their satisfaction. We believe that building strong, long-lasting relationships with our customers is the key to our success, and we are committed to going above and beyond to deliver the best possible service and support. So, we always try to put our customers first and strive to exceed their expectations.</p>

                <h1 id="title2">More affordable then ever</h1>
                <p>A reason why our services are cheaper is because we are highly efficient and focused. We don't have to deal with the bureaucracy and red tape that often comes with larger agencies, so we can move quickly and get things done faster. This means that our clients get the same high-quality work that they would get from a larger agency, but in a shorter amount of time and at a lower cost. Additionally, as a solo web development agency, we are able to offer our services at a lower cost because we do not have the overhead expenses that come with running a larger agency. We do not have to worry about the costs of maintaining a physical office</p>

        <p>
            Customization: While WordPress is a powerful and popular content management system, it does have limitations in terms of customization. It is based on a set of pre-designed templates and themes, which can be limiting for clients who want a truly unique and customized website. A professional web development agency like ours can offer a higher level of customization and can build a website from scratch to meet the specific needs and goals of our clients.
<br> <br>
Expertise and experience: A professional web development agency like ours has a team of experienced and skilled professionals who have a deep understanding of web development best practices and technologies. We can bring this expertise to bear on our clients' projects, ensuring that the final product is of the highest quality and meets all of their requirements. In contrast, WordPress is a software platform that is designed to be easy to use, but it may not offer the same level of expertise and experience as a team of professional web developers.
<br> <br>
Support and maintenance: A professional web development agency like ours is able to offer ongoing support and maintenance for our clients' websites. We can help with updates, bug fixes, and other issues that may arise, ensuring that our clients' websites are always running smoothly and effectively. In contrast, WordPress is a self-service platform, which means that clients are responsible for their own updates and maintenance.

            Normal Static package: It costs 25 euros and it does the job. Don't expect anything too fancy for this price. You can pick the design but there's a limit to your design options based on how hard is to recreate the design. This package is good for portfolios, local business websites and other basic stuff.
            <br> <br>
            Extra Static package: It costs 50 euros, it's a good package overall. It accepts pretty much all designs.
            <br> <br>
            Dynamic Package: The price is 100 euros. This is for dynamic websites. With dynamic websites and databases, you can make a lot of things. Like login pages, gathering emails, APIs and more, you can store any type of information. This will require for you to make a free/paid database using MongoDB atlas. If you contact us through discord or you ask through the other contracting option we will provide you with instructions on how to make a DB using MongoDB atlas. but if you just want a dynamic website without any database you can still do it for 70 euros
